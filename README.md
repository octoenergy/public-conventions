# Kraken Technologies coding conventions

This repo contains conventions for code written at Kraken Technologies (the
technology tentacle of [Octopus Energy Group][group]).

These conventions are a curated subset of the full collection, chosen for their
relevance to external developers and companies. We hope you find them useful.

If you'd like to get access to
the complete set of Kraken Tech coding conventions, you'll need to [apply for a job
here][jobs] 😜.
